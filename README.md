RUSH-LIST

DEVINE-SE-22

Our Project aims to simplify the task of tracking the commodities needed to be carries/bought by the students when they arrive at the hostel for the first time.

The admin can add items that are to be displayed in the list. Seniors/Freshers can do the following:
Fresher: After logging in, they can see the list of all commodities displayed, and whether they are available in the campus,with the seniors or if they need to be carried from their homes.
Senior: After logging in, they can add an item that they are willing to sell along with a suitable price and remove the existing deal once the product has been sold.

Working:

1)Run the commands given sql queries.txt in sql command line one by one
